- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working as senior software engineer using C#/VB .NET and .NET in general writing WMS software.
- :heart: I love open source and work on personal projects whether possible, I enjoy contributing to other projects and share opinions with other people.
- :star2: I like to write game engine code and explore the different graphics APIs out there (Direct3D12, Vulkan, Metal or OpenGL). Therefore, I have created several projects to abstract the graphics APIs to make it easier to do graphics programming, which is where my main focus is. I love learning and read about new rendering techniques and try to implement them.

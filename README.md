### Hi there ðŸ‘‹ My name is Amer Koleci

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working as senior software engineer using C#/VB .NET and .NET in general writing WMS software.

- :heart: I love open source and work on personal projects whether possible, I enjoy contributing to other projects and share opinions with other people.
- :star2: I like to write game engine code and explore the different graphics APIs out there (Direct3D12, Vulkan, Metal or OpenGL). Therefore, I have created several projects to abstract the graphics APIs to make it easier to do graphics programming, which is where my main focus is. I love learning and read about new rendering techniques and try to implement them. 
- ðŸ’¬ If you have any question feel free to contact me and I will gladly reply.
- ðŸ¤” If you like to join my open source project feel free to do so but submitting PR or opening issues.
